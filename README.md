# fsr
This is a custom clone of the ls linux utility written in Rust. There is no reason to use this, it's a simple project to serve as a starter project for getting to know Rust and use of GitHub Actions.

Usage: fsr [-h|--help] [path [PATH ...]]

Positional Arguments:
path: Path(s) to list.

Optional Arguments:
-h, --help: Show this help message and exit.
